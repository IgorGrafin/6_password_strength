# Password Strength Calculator

Simple password checker. It shows the strenght of your password from 0 to 10 points.

# Quickstart

You should download the dictionary of the most common passwords(e.g. from [here](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/10k_most_common.txt)) and save it as blacklist.txt.

If you don't the maximum score would be 7. 

Example of script launch on Linux, Python 3.5:

```bash

$ python password_strength.py

```
Launching on Windows via CMD or PowerShell is the same. 

Example:
```
python password_strength.py
Input password:ghbdtnVbh432
Password strength =  6
```
